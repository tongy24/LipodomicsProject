# EPSRC Lipodomics Project

In 2017, I was awarded a scholarship to work on a Lipodomics (the study of Lipids and Fatty Acids) at the University of Leeds, working with Dr James Smith. The work was in the field of Bio-statistics and Computational Biology, aiming to model a biochemical process in the body via Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and a machine learning technique Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering (BHC). This model worked to an extent; however in order to achieve groundbreaking results, it was suggested that non-stationary data be collected; and as such a framework for clinicians and academics to collaborate was created, and can be found in this repository.
